# Bogglefr
A french Boggle

Clone in any directory you want, the path to which we will call PATH from now on.
Then, go in the ~/.bashrc file, and add the following line at the end (replacing PATH with the actual path):
    
    alias bogglefr='python3 PATH/Bogglefr/Boggle_francais.py PATH/Bogglefr/repertoire_francais_tout.txt'

To play, type "bogglefr" in the shell prompt.
