# Bogglefr
A french Boggle

Clone in any directory you want, the path to which we will call *path* from now on.
Then, go in the $HOME/.bashrc file, and add the following line at the end :
    
    alias bogglefr='python3 *path*/Bogglefr/Boggle_francais.py *path*/Bogglefr/repertoire_francais_tout.txt'

To play, type "bogglefr" in the shell prompt.
